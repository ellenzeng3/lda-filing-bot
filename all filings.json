The Loc Nation Dollar (LND) A Fiat Restitution Currency Pegged to the United States Dollar (USD) Author: Rev. Dr. Christina Clement, HH Empress Queen Christina Clement Institution: State of Loc Nation Global Public Benefit Corporation (SoLN GPBC) Date: 2025 Edition Contact: info@stateoflocnation.com Executive Summary The Loc Nation Dollar (LND) is a fiat currency pegged to the United States Dollar (USD), established under the sovereign authority of the State of Loc Nation Global Public Benefit Corporation (SoLN GPBC). It exists as a restitution-based currency designed to address centuries of systemic economic exclusion, particularly the impacts of redlining, slavery, and underfunding of historically disadvantaged communities. Unlike cryptocurrencies or commodities, LND operates as legal tender within the jurisdiction of SoLN GPBC and is recognized through UCC filings, trust structures, executive mandates, and lobbying disclosures. The peg to USD ensures stability, global interoperability, and parallel accounting treatment. 1. Introduction The global financial system has long recognized the role of sovereign-issued fiat currencies as the foundation of economic order. Just as the U.S. Dollar (USD) is backed by statute (31 USC 5103) and governed by the Treasury and Federal Reserve, the LND is backed by the SoLN Restitution Act, UCC filings, court-filed constitutional charter, and lobbying disclosures in the congressional record. The purpose of this white paper is to define the monetary, legal, and technical framework of LND; establish its peg to USD as a parallel fiat system; present LNDs restitutionary purpose for historically disadvantaged populations; and provide documentation for LCCN cataloging, ISO 4217 registration, and federal docket filing. 2. Legal and Governance Framework Sovereign Authority: LND issuance authorized under the SoLN GPBC Constitution and executive mandates. UCC Filings: Collateral securing LND documented under UCC Financing Statement No. 044-2025-002376 and related filings. Court Constitution: The SoLN Constitution is filed into federal judicial records (Case Nos. 1:24-cv-00479-RC and 24-5263). Trust Oversight: Managed by Clement Dynasty Dynasty Trust and affiliated fiduciary entities. Parallel U.S. Statutory Authority: Operates consistent with Article I, Sec. 10 of the U.S. Constitution and 31 USC 5103 (recognition of legal tender). Lobbying Records: SoLN GPBC registered in congressional databases (LegiStorm) and files LD-203 reports, embedding its restitution mandate in the legislative record. 3. Monetary Design of LND Fiat Structure: LND is not commodity-backed but rests on the restitutionary authority of SoLN and trust-held collateral (art, receivables, land claims). Peg: Fixed at 1 LND = 750 USD, ensuring parity with U.S. dollar stability while providing expanded restitutionary value. Issuance: Through SoLN Treasury under executive authority, supported by certified Safe Keeping Receipts (SKRs) and trust-backed instruments. Redemption: LND may be exchanged for USD equivalents under restitution settlements, credit union partnerships, and sovereign transactions. 4. Economic Justification Restitution Mandate: LND exists to correct 400 years of economic exclusion by creating a parallel fiat structure directly tied to USD, guaranteeing equity of access. Stability vs. Crypto: Unlike volatile digital assets, LND ensures confidence through fiat peg, permanent collateralization, and sovereign guarantees. Use of Funds: Supports land reclamation, population restitution (1.4 trillion allocation claim), and community wealth programs. 5. Technical Infrastructure Ledgering: All LND transactions recorded under sovereign financial reporting aligned with GASB and FASAB standards. Payment Messaging: Conforms with ISO 20022 XML message sets, enabling Fedwire/SWIFT-like compatibility. Currency Coding: Eligible under ISO 4217:2015 user-assigned range (XA-XZ) for non-state sovereign issuers. Auditability: Supported by quarterly restitution invoices, GAO submissions, FinCEN filings, and certified court filings. 6. Use Cases Federal Restitution: Settlement of HR 40 and S 40 reparative research contracts. Financial Services: Partnerships with credit unions (Loc Community Association CU) for conversion into USD. International Trade: Diaspora remittances, treaty-based settlement agreements, and intergovernmental transfers. Community Wealth: Housing, healthcare, education, and local business financing. 7. Comparative Analysis: USD vs. LND Attribute USD (Federal) Legal Tender Statute 31 USC 5103 LND (SoLN) SoLN Restitution Act; UCC Filings; Court Constitution Issuing Authority Peg Backing U.S. Treasury / Federal Reserve Free-floating fiat SoLN Treasury / GPBC Trust Pegged 1 LND = 750 USD Full faith and credit of U.S. government Collateralized via trust, UCC filings, restitution receivables Reporting Standards Global Code 8. Global Context FASAB (federal) ISO 4217 'USD' GASB + FASAB + Court/FinCEN filings ISO 4217 application (user-assigned XA-XZ) Precedents: Euro (EUR) established via EU treaties and ISO 4217 assignment; IMFs Special Drawing Rights (SDR) as basket currency. Positioning: LND joins these as a sovereign fiat initiative, distinct from crypto or commodity systems. Strategic Aim: Provide a legal, technical, and moral precedent for restitutionary currencies worldwide. 9. Conclusion The Loc Nation Dollar (LND) is a sovereign, fiat, USD-pegged currency designed to fulfill the restitution mandate of the State of Loc Nation Global Public Benefit Corporation. Through UCC filings, court-filed constitution, lobbying records, trust collateralization, and ISO-aligned technical infrastructure, LND provides a stable, parallel fiat framework for economic justice. Its documentation in this white paper ensures that LND is recognized in archival, regulatory, and academic systems. Filing this paper for an LCCN at the Library of Congress, submitting it to ISO 4217, and lodging it in federal public comment dockets will permanently secure LNDs status as a parallel, lawful fiat currency.

The Loc Nation Dollar (LND) A Fiat Restitution Currency Pegged to the United States Dollar (USD) Author: Rev. Dr. Christina Clement, HH Empress Queen Christina Clement Institution: State of Loc Nation Global Public Benefit Corporation (SoLN GPBC) Date: 2025 Edition Contact: info@stateoflocnation.com Executive Summary The Loc Nation Dollar (LND) is a fiat currency pegged to the United States Dollar (USD), established under the sovereign authority of the State of Loc Nation Global Public Benefit Corporation (SoLN GPBC). It exists as a restitution-based currency designed to address centuries of systemic economic exclusion, particularly the impacts of redlining, slavery, and underfunding of historically disadvantaged communities. Unlike cryptocurrencies or commodities, LND operates as legal tender within the jurisdiction of SoLN GPBC and is recognized through UCC filings, trust structures, executive mandates, and lobbying disclosures. The peg to USD ensures stability, global interoperability, and parallel accounting treatment. 1. Introduction The global financial system has long recognized the role of sovereign-issued fiat currencies as the foundation of economic order. Just as the U.S. Dollar (USD) is backed by statute (31 USC 5103) and governed by the Treasury and Federal Reserve, the LND is backed by the SoLN Restitution Act, UCC filings, court-filed constitutional charter, and lobbying disclosures in the congressional record. The purpose of this white paper is to define the monetary, legal, and technical framework of LND; establish its peg to USD as a parallel fiat system; present LNDs restitutionary purpose for historically disadvantaged populations; and provide documentation for LCCN cataloging, ISO 4217 registration, and federal docket filing. 2. Legal and Governance Framework Sovereign Authority: LND issuance authorized under the SoLN GPBC Constitution and executive mandates. UCC Filings: Collateral securing LND documented under UCC Financing Statement No. 044-2025-002376 and related filings. Court Constitution: The SoLN Constitution is filed into federal judicial records (Case Nos. 1:24-cv-00479-RC and 24-5263). Trust Oversight: Managed by Clement Dynasty Dynasty Trust and affiliated fiduciary entities. Parallel U.S. Statutory Authority: Operates consistent with Article I, Sec. 10 of the U.S. Constitution and 31 USC 5103 (recognition of legal tender). Lobbying Records: SoLN GPBC registered in congressional databases (LegiStorm) and files LD-203 reports, embedding its restitution mandate in the legislative record. 3. Monetary Design of LND Fiat Structure: LND is not commodity-backed but rests on the restitutionary authority of SoLN and trust-held collateral (art, receivables, land claims). Peg: Fixed at 1 LND = 750 USD, ensuring parity with U.S. dollar stability while providing expanded restitutionary value. Issuance: Through SoLN Treasury under executive authority, supported by certified Safe Keeping Receipts (SKRs) and trust-backed instruments. Redemption: LND may be exchanged for USD equivalents under restitution settlements, credit union partnerships, and sovereign transactions. 4. Economic Justification Restitution Mandate: LND exists to correct 400 years of economic exclusion by creating a parallel fiat structure directly tied to USD, guaranteeing equity of access. Stability vs. Crypto: Unlike volatile digital assets, LND ensures confidence through fiat peg, permanent collateralization, and sovereign guarantees. Use of Funds: Supports land reclamation, population restitution (1.4 trillion allocation claim), and community wealth programs. 5. Technical Infrastructure Ledgering: All LND transactions recorded under sovereign financial reporting aligned with GASB and FASAB standards. Payment Messaging: Conforms with ISO 20022 XML message sets, enabling Fedwire/SWIFT-like compatibility. Currency Coding: Eligible under ISO 4217:2015 user-assigned range (XA-XZ) for non-state sovereign issuers. Auditability: Supported by quarterly restitution invoices, GAO submissions, FinCEN filings, and certified court filings. 6. Use Cases Federal Restitution: Settlement of HR 40 and S 40 reparative research contracts. Financial Services: Partnerships with credit unions (Loc Community Association CU) for conversion into USD. International Trade: Diaspora remittances, treaty-based settlement agreements, and intergovernmental transfers. Community Wealth: Housing, healthcare, education, and local business financing. 7.
